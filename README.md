This repository implements several classic AI and Machine Learning models from the scratch using numpy.

This repo includes the following model types: decision tree, K means clustering, linear and logistic regression, naive
bayes classifier, support vector machine, and basic Neural Network model (3D Convolutional Neural Network, Linear Neural
Network, Pooling operation, Flatten operation, Relu, Sigmoid and Softmax activation functions).

This repo formats code using Black in GitHub Actions, please note that formatting code on git is no exactly a good
practice but this code shows how it can be done if needed, a better practice is only lining on git and setting up commit
hooks to do the formatting, like what I've done in my kubernetes_test repo.
