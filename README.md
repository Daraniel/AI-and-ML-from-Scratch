This repository implements several classic AI and Machine Learning models from the scratch using numpy.

This repo includes the following model types: decision tree, K means clustering, linear and logistic regression, naive
bayes classifier, support vector machine, and basic Neural Network model (3D Convolutional Neural Network, Linear Neural
Network, Pooling operation, Flatten operation, Relu, Sigmoid and Softmax activation functions).
